<!-- 1. HTML Basics
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's used to structure content on a webpage.
    HTML elements are written using tags enclosed in angle brackets (<>). Most elements have an opening tag (e.g., <div>) and a closing tag (e.g., </div>), with content in between.
2. Understanding <div>
    The <div> element is a container that groups content together. It's short for "division."
    <div> doesn't apply any styling or functionality on its own but is often used as a block-level container to organize content, which can then be styled with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
3. Class Attribute
    THE CLASS ATTRIBUTE IS USED TO ASSIGN A NAME TO THE ELEMENT.This name can be used in CSS or JavaScript to style or interact with the element.
    In this case, the class is bg-blck.
4. CSS Classes
    A CSS class is a style definition that you can apply to HTML elements.
    To style an element with the class bg-blck, you would create a rule in your CSS file, like this -->


        <!-- INNERHTML : SHOWS EVERYTHING EVEN THE HTML file
            INNERTEXT : SHOWS ALL TEXT EVEN THOSE WHICH ARE HIDDEN
            TEXTCONTENT : SHOWS ONLY VISBLE TEXT ON webpage -->


            <!-- • QuerySelector returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector, while QuerySelectorAll returns a static NodeList of all elements matching the selector.

            • Using QuerySelector allows you to manipulate individual elements, while QuerySelectorAll enables bulk manipulation of elements. -->

<!-- {Array.from(any name)} the name should be specified by the HTMLlist or NODElist 
     • The 'from' method can be used to convert HTML collections to arrays
     • After converting, all array methods can be applied for manipulation -->
