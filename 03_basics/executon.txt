 Understanding JavaScript Code Execution

• JavaScript code executes in a sequential manner.

• The code execution can be visualized using the browser's memory.

01:56 JavaScript Execution Context is how the script runs and executes code.

• The script runs in two phases.

• The global execution context is the first context created and is referred to a variable.

05:40 The memory creation phase is the first phase in executing JavaScript code.

• During the memory creation phase, variables are declared and memory space is allocated for them.

• Mathematical functions and other operations are not executed during this phase.

07:33 The execution of JavaScript code involves a Global Execution phase and a Memory Creation phase.

• The Global Execution phase runs the code first and is responsible for executing all the code, regardless of its size.

• The Memory Creation phase collects and defines all the variables in the code.

11:36 JavaScript executes code by creating separate execution contexts for each function.

• Each function has its own sandbox of variables and an execution thread.

• Memory and execution phases are performed within each execution context.

13:40 Execution context is where the code is executed and variables are stored.

• The execution context contains the definition of variables and their values.

• The execution context determines the order of execution and the flow of the program.

17:29 Execution context and call stack are key components of JavaScript execution.

• The memory phase stores variables and functions.

• The execution phase executes code and updates values in the execution context.

19:10 Understanding execution context and call stack in JavaScript

• Execution context determines how JavaScript code is executed

• Call stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, determining the order of execution

23:03 Execution process in JavaScript involves loading, memory phase, and execution phase

• Code execution is done step by step using breakpoints and step-through feature

• Each function call creates a new frame in the call stack with its own memory and execution context

24:44 Executing code and call stack explained

• Executing code involves running through each step in a program

• The call stack keeps track of function calls and their execution
